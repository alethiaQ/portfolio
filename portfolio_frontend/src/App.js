              <Code>
                Thanks for peaking at my page, I'll try to get straight to the point. I'm a fullstack developer with expertise in React, Angular, Java and Ruby on Rails to name a few. I've worked professionally for 4 years as a software developer building large scale applications end to end. I also spent those 4 years in a hybrid environment, where a portion of my time was dedicated to DevOps work. So, I have the ability to thrive in high-stress environments and simultaneously build and design clean, moduler, and scalabe applications that fit the needs of our customers. Please check out my resume for a bit more.

                I've completed a wide range of personal projects, from a Stranger Things Directory CLI Ruby Gem, A Single Page Application featuring the beloved Lorax and a menacing "Tree Gobbling" Snake game (JavaScript, Rails, SQL), to working in a small group leading React Development for an end-to-end Travel Buddy application (React, AWS, Java). Although, there is a gap of activity on my Github from when I was at my previous role, it's still a great place to check out my code and see what I'm up to today.
